# Laser Game Leaderboard Project - Frontend

This directory contains the frontend code for the Laser Game Leaderboard project. The frontend is responsible for the user interface of the laser game and interacts with the backend API to manage leaderboard scores.

## Project Structure

- **pages/lasergame/index.html**: The main HTML file for the laser game, containing the structure of the game interface.
- **pages/lasergame/styles/game.css**: CSS styles for the laser game, defining the visual appearance of the game elements.
- **pages/lasergame/assets/scripts/game.js**: JavaScript code for the laser game, handling game logic, user interactions, and score management.
- **pages/lasergame/assets/scripts/api.js**: Functions for making API calls to the backend, specifically for saving and retrieving leaderboard scores.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd lasergame-leaderboard-project/frontend
   ```

2. **Open the Project**: Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the game.

3. **API Integration**: Ensure that the backend API is running and accessible. The frontend will make requests to the backend to save and retrieve scores.
